        question: "tx_hash in the recent_deposit response for all SOL deposits is empty",
        answer:
          "This information is not available for Solana because the mechanism of deposit tracking works a bit differently there.",
      },
      {
        question: "Is there a reason why my UTXOs aren't being swept on the BTC ? I sent 5,000 sats",
        answer:
          `The deposit process begins once the transfer transaction on the foreign network has been completed.  When the balance of the user's unique deposit address has become positive our indexer generates a deposit event and assigns it a PENDING status.

          The next step is collecting the current tokens in storage. The result of this process will be either a COMPLETED or FAILED status. Deposits with a FAILED status are currently handled manually and eventually updated to the COMPLETED status.
          
          On EVM networks, deposits can bypass the PENDING status due to the faster processing and transfer completion times.
          
          The data structure for the PENDING and FAILED statuses is identical to that of the COMPLETED status.
          
          Regarding BTC deposits: If you want to make a deposit to an account that hasnâ€™t yet been connected to the application - this is possible but requires extreme caution. You can request a deposit address by calling the bridge API (deposit_address) and specifying the account_id parameter. The account_id can be a NEAR account, an EVM address, or a SOL address to which you have access.
          
          It is recommended starting with a small amount for experimentation. After the deposit is completed, you can connect wallet and check the tokens.`,

      {
        question: "ETH-connector migration",
        answer:
          "Because of the split of ETH-connector, auroracontract now acts as a NEP-141 proxy to eth.bridge.near.",
      },
