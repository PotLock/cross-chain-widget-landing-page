# POTLOCK Playground Frontend

Welcome to the **POTLOCK Playground Frontend**, an interactive environment designed to test and explore the features of the POTLOCK Cross Chain Donation Widget. This frontend allows developers and users to experiment with widget configurations, visualize donation flows, and simulate cross-chain transactions.

## Features

- **Interactive Widget Testing**: Adjust and test widget settings in real-time.
- **Cross-Chain Simulation**: Simulate donations across networks like NEAR, Solana, Ethereum, and more.
- **Live Preview**: See immediate changes to themes, colors, and configurations.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for desktop and mobile views.
